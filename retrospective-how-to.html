                    <h3>What is a Retrospective?</h3>
                    <p>A ritual gathering of a community at the end of the project
                    to review the events and learn from experience. No one knows the
                    whole story of a project. Each person has a piece of the story.
                    The retrospective ritual is the collective telling of the story 
                    and mining the experience for wisdom. [KERTH]</p>

                    <h3>The Retrospective Prime Directive</h3>
                    <blockquote>"Regardless of what we discover, we understand and 
                    that everyone did the best job he or she could, given what was 
                    known at the time, his or her skills and abilities, the resources 
                    available, and the situation at hand."</blockquote>

                        The person who manages the flow of the retrospective and focuses on bringing out 
                        all the information so the team can focus on just recalling the events. 
                        He/She shouldn't be joining the discussion because he/she can greatly affect 
                        the flow of ideas making it biased.

                        <h3>The Team</h3>
                        The members of the project team. Their focus is to recall the details 
                        of the events as much as possible to guide them in understanding 
                        the whole picture.
